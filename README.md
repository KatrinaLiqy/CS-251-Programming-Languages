# CS-251-Programming-Languages

CS 251 Programming Languages is a computer science course at Carleton College. Instructed by professor James Ryan, I took the class in Winter 2021-2022. This repository contains code I wrote for coursework, homework and projects.
Specifically, I built a Scheme interpreter in C from scratch.
